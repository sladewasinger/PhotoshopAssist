# PhotoshopAssist
This project was initially created to fix the annoying Windows beep when zooming and then panning in Photoshop.
The problem is this:
* You zoom in by [alt]+scrollwheel
* You then release [alt], and attempt to pan around the image by pressing and holding [space]
* Before you can pan, Windows beeps at you because the alt-menus are shown, and [space] isn't a valid menu.
* The solution is to press [alt] again before pressing [space] to pan... or just run my program in the backround.
